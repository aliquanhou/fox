## Investigation Log

### INV-001: fn_40A590
- Question: What does this function do?
- Tool calls: get_function, get_callees, get_callers
- Evidence: E-FUNC-0001, E-CALLEES-0002, E-CALLERS-0003
- Conclusion:
  FACT: 1322 lines, 8 callees, CloseHandle+MessageBoxA+SendMessageA, 1 caller (fn_455E4C)
  HYPOTHESIS: UI-related routine (dialog/message handler)
  UNKNOWN: exact purpose, control flow
- Confidence: medium
- Next: investigate fn_455E4C (the only caller)

### INV-002: fn_41EDF0
- Known: machine_process string @ 0x4591B8 → push @ 0x1FF4A
- APIs: LoadStringA, LoadIconA, LoadCursorA
- Conclusion:
  FACT: references machine_process, calls Load* APIs
  HYPOTHESIS: window class preparation
  UNKNOWN: no RegisterClassEx evidence yet
- Confidence: medium

### INV-003: fn_41A870
- Known: CreateFileA call
- Hypothesis: file open (Pattern Load?)
- Confidence: low
- Next: verify what files it opens

### INV-006: NtcMach.exe File I/O Analysis
- Question: Where is the file I/O core?
- Evidence: Only fn_41A870 has CreateFileA (2 calls, 42 lines)
- Evidence ID: E-FILEIO-0006
- Conclusion:
  FACT: fn_41A870 = file open wrapper (2x CreateFileA)
  FACT: No file name strings (dynamic construction)
  HYPOTHESIS: Generic file open utility, called by pattern load/save
  UNKNOWN: which files it opens
- Confidence: medium
- Priority: P1

### INV-007: NTCDLLG Call Chain
- Question: How does the call graph work?
- Evidence: fn_100187E1 → fn_10018708 → 13 callees
- Conclusion:
  FACT: fn_100187E1 is thin wrapper (103 lines)
  FACT: fn_10018708 is main dispatcher (73 lines, 13 callees)
  FACT: callees are all small (20-259 lines) with only CloseHandle
  HYPOTHESIS: Device commands are encapsulated in small functions
  UNKNOWN: exact command mapping
- Confidence: high
